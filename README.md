# Graph Search Algorithms

This project implements graph search algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph
The project includes the following classes:

1. `Vertex`: Represents a vertex in a graph
2. `Edge`: Represents an edge connecting two vertices in a graph with a weight
3. `Graph`: Represents an unweighted graph 
4. `WeightedGraph`: Represents a weighted graph 
5. `Djikstra`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph
6. `Search`: Provides a common structure for search algorithms and includes functionality for path reconstruction
